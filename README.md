Node Application

This Assignment was not to hard untill the end when we had to hide the secret spotify keys in the .env folder.
The app runs and can successfully access the Spofity  for track information and the Bands in Town API to find out when any given artist 
will be hosting any upcoming concerts. 
I dont have any screenshots as of right now because ocnce i encoded the .env information it is failing and since this is a public repo i cannot push the working version up right now becase it does have sensitive account information exposed.
Unfortunately I ran out of time to debug this but will have a fixed running version pushed up later this week.
